MiddleWare:

Middleware in asp.net core is simple software component means it like a c# Classes
which are Assembled together  to handle your pipilined Request and Response


---Middleware perform important task

by using next method within your middleware

2)it can execute logic  before and after making request to the next middleware in pipeline 


what are the different type of job middle do
1)some middleware do authentication
2)some middleware do Logging
3)some Middlewarecomponent help to read javascript file and css and images

there are so many other prefined middle ware which perform different operation

//Note: Terminal Middle ware or Short Circuit Middleware.
            // Run method is there in RunExtensions class but call by using app variable as it Extentend with IapplicationBuilder inferface 
            //second object is Request Delegate which call HttpContext(handle request and response information )
            //app.Run(async (context) =>//annoymonus method in run method to write some text
            //{
            //    await context.Response.WriteAsync("My First UserDefine Middleware");
            //});

            //app.Run(async (context) =>
            //{
            //    await context.Response.WriteAsync("My second UserDefine Middleware");
            //});

            it will handle all request which user is going to make using url. 
            it will not allow any other middleware to execute
